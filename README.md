Algorithm for crowd management at Mahakumbh.
Efficient River Dipping Algorithm

📌 Problem Description

In a city with a river, a large crowd (k ≫ n) arrives to take a dip. Due to limited space, only n people can dip at a time, leading to congestion. The goal is to design an efficient algorithm that minimizes waiting time and walking distance, ensuring smooth movement and maximizing throughput.

🔍 Rough Analysis

People arrive randomly and queue up to enter.

Only n slots are available for dipping at any time.

Each person spends t seconds in the water.

New arrivals should take vacant slots immediately to minimize idle time.

Walking distance should be minimized, avoiding unnecessary chaos in movement.

📊 In-Depth Analysis

To efficiently manage the crowd, the algorithm utilizes:

1️⃣ Circular Queue for Waiting Line (O(1) Operations)

Allows fast enqueue/dequeue for large k values.

Eliminates shifting overhead in standard queues.

2️⃣ Min-Heap for Slot Management (O(log n) Allocation)

Tracks next available slot efficiently.

Ensures people enter as soon as space is available.

3️⃣ Batch Processing (Greedy Assignment of Up to min(n, 10))

Moves multiple people at once when enough slots are available.

Reduces processing overhead and ensures optimal slot usage.

4️⃣ Greedy Slot Pre-Filling (Zero Idle Time Strategy)

Ensures no delay between dips by pre-assigning available slots immediately.

Maintains a continuous flow, reducing congestion.

🚀 Why This Approach is Better

Feature

Optimization

Circular Queue

O(1) enqueue/dequeue for large k

Min-Heap Slot Tracking

O(log n) efficient slot assignment

Batch Processing

Moves min(n,10) people at once, reducing iterations

Greedy Pre-Filling

Zero idle time, maximizing capacity utilization

Time Complexity:

✅ O(k/n + log n) ≪ O(k log n) (Much faster for large k values)

📜 How to Use the Code

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/river-dipping.git
cd river-dipping

Run the Python script:

python river_dipping.py

Adjust n (number of slots) and k (total people) as needed.

🏆 Key Benefits

Handles millions of people efficiently.

Ensures minimum waiting time and smooth transitions.

Prevents chaos in movement, optimizing walking distance.

🚀 Scalable, fast, and perfect for real-world crowd management!
